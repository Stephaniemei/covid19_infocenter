												<p>
												COVID-19 vaccines assist our bodies in developing immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without the need for us to become ill.
												Vaccines provide protection in a variety of ways.
												However, with all vaccines, the body is left with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes with the ability to fight the virus in the future. 
												</p>
												
                                                <p>
												T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes are typically produced a few weeks after vaccination.
												As a result, a person could become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and becomes ill as a result of the vaccine failing to provide protection. 
												</p>
												
												<p>
												Symptoms such as fever can occur after vaccination due to the process of building immunity. These symptoms are normal and indicate that the body is strengthening its defences.
												</p>

                                        <p>
										In the United States, there are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are either authorised and recommended or are undergoing large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials.
										The descriptions below explain how each type of vaccine prompts our bodies to recognise and protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19.
										Any of these vaccines cannot transmit COVID-19. 
										</p>
                                        
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
											<strong>mRNA vaccines: </strong> <br>
											Contain virus material that causes COVID-19, which instructs our cells to make a harmless virus-specific protein.
											After making copies of the protein, our cells destroy the vaccine's genetic material.
											Our bodies recognise that the protein shouldn't be there and produce T- and B-lymphocytes with the ability to fight the COVID-19 virus if we become infected again. 
											</li>
											
                                            <li>
											<strong>Protein subunit vaccines: </strong> <br>
											Instead of the entire germ, use harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19.
											Once we've been vaccinated, our bodies recognise that the protein shouldn't be there and produce T-lymphocytes and antibodies that will be able to remember to fight against COVID-19 viruses if we become infected again. 
											</li>
											
											<li>
											<strong>Vector vaccines: </strong> <br>
											Contain a modified version of a virus other than COVID-19.
											There is material from the virus that causes COVID-19 within the shell of the modified virus.
											A “viral vector” is what this is.
											Once inside our cells, the viral vector's genetic material instructs the cells to produce a protein specific to the virus that causes COVID-19.
											Our cells replicate the protein by following these instructions.
											This causes our bodies to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, which will remember how to fight the virus if we become infected again in the future. 
											</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>Two shots of some COVID-19 vaccines are required to be fully vaccinated.</p>
										
										<ul>
											<li>You will be treated as fully vaccinated two weeks after your second shot when you receive a COVID-19 vaccine that requires two shots. The COVID-19 vaccines from <a href = "page1.html">Pfizer-BioNTech</a> and <a href = "page2.html">Moderna</a> require two shots. </li>
											<li>If you receive a COVID-19 vaccine that only needs one injection, you are considered completely vaccinated two weeks later. <a href = "page3.html">Johnson & Johnson's Janssen</a> COVID-19 vaccine takes only one injection. </li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>
										You're not fully protected if you have been shot less than two weeks or if you still need your second shot.
										Continue to take all preventative measures before you have received your full vaccination (two weeks after your final shot).
