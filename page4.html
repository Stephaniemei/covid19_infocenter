                                                <p>
												COVID-19 vaccines help our bodies develop immunity to the virus that causes COVID-19 without us having to get the illness. 
												Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection. But with all types of vaccines, the body is left 
												with a supply of “memory” T-lymphocytes as well as B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future.
												</p>
                                                <p>
												It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to produce T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes. Therefore, it is 
												possible that a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and then 
												get sick because the vaccine did not have enough time to provide protection.
												</p>
												<p>
												Sometimes after vaccination, the process of building immunity can cause symptoms, such as fever. These symptoms are normal 
												and are signs that the body is building immunity.
												</p>

                                        <p>
										Currently, there are three main types of COVID-19 vaccines that are authorized and recommended, or undergoing large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials in the United States. 
										Below is a description of how each type of vaccine prompts our bodies to recognize and protect us from the virus that causes COVID-19. None of these vaccines can give you COVID-19.
										</p>
                                        
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>
											<strong>mRNA vaccines</strong> contain material from the virus that causes COVID-19 that gives our cell instructions for how to make a harmless protein that is unique to the virus.
											After our cells make copies of the protein, they destroy the genetic material from the vaccine. Our bodies recognize that the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and 
											B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future.
											</li>
											
                                            <li>
											<strong>Protein subunit vaccines</strong> include harmless pieces (proteins) of the virus that causes COVID-19 instead of the entire germ. Once vaccinated, our bodies recognize that 
											the protein should not be there and build T-lymphocytes and antibodies that will remember how to fight the virus that causes COVID-19 if we are infected in the future.
											</li>
											
											<li>
											<strong>Vector vaccines</strong> contain a modified version of a different virus than the one that causes COVID-19. Inside the shell of the modified virus, there is material from the 
											virus that causes COVID-19. This is called a “viral vector.” Once the viral vector is inside our cells, the genetic material gives cells instructions to make a protein that is unique 
											to the virus that causes COVID-19. Using these instructions, our cells make copies of the protein. This prompts our bodies to build T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember 
											how to fight that virus if we are infected in the future.
											</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <p>To be fully vaccinated, you will need two shots of some COVID-19 vaccines.</p>
										
										<ul>
											<li>If you get a COVID-19 vaccine that requires two shots, you are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after your second shot. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines require two shots.</li>
											<li>If you get a COVID-19 vaccine that requires one shot, you are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after your shot. Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine only requires one shot.</li>
										</ul>
										
										<p>If it has been less than two weeks since your shot, or if you still need to get your second shot, you are NOT fully protected. Keep taking all prevention steps until you are fully vaccinated (two weeks after your final shot).</p>
